This is a prototype of the Forklift Safety Simulation project I made at my internship using Unity3D.
Here we have a functional forklift that can move, lift a box, and place it onto an elevated surface.
THhs was made in unity version 2022.3.30. To try it for yourself simply import the package file into your unity project and play it in your editor. Use WASD to move, spacebar to break and press the 'I' and 'K' keys to move the forks up and down.
Assets for Forklift and objects were downloaded from the unity Asset store: https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/props/industrial/low-poly-forklift-176653
