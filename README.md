This is a prototype of the Forklift Safety Simulation project I made at my internship using Unity3D.
Here we have a functional forklift that can move, lift a box, and place it onto an elevated surface.
Assets for Forklift and objects were downloaded from the unity Asset store: https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/props/industrial/low-poly-forklift-176653
